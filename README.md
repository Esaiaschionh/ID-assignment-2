# ID-assignment-2
Project Outline:

Research and gather data on current COVID-19 cases around the world, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates.
Design and develop an interactive map that displays this information, allowing users to explore and interact with the data.
Incorporate news updates and articles related to COVID-19 and pandemics in general to educate users on the subject.
Implement a system for updating the statistics on the map in real-time as new data becomes available.
Utilise gamification elements, such as challenges and rewards, to engage users and encourage them to learn more about the pandemic and its effects on different regions.
Test the map with a small group of users to gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments before releasing it to the public.
Launch the interactive map and actively promote it to encourage widespread use and engagement.
Continuously monitor and update the map with new information and features to ensure that it remains accurate and useful for users.
