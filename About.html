            <h1>About COVID-19</h1>
        </header>
        
            <p>COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus, is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and the virus has since spread rapidly to become a global pandemic.</p>
            <p>The symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, and can include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and body aches. While many people who contract COVID-19 will recover without serious complications, the virus can be particularly dangerous for older adults and people with underlying health conditions.</p>
            <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, health officials recommend practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly, wearing a mask in public, and practicing physical distancing. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, it's important to self-isolate and seek medical attention as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>This website aims to provide up-to-date information on the COVID-19 pandemic, including news, statistics, and resources for staying safe and healthy during the pandemic.</p>

            <h1>Ways to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19</h1>
        </header>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Wear a mask: Wearing a mask in public can help prevent the spread of respiratory droplets that may contain the virus. Make sure the mask covers both your nose and mouth and fits snugly.</li>
                <li>Practice physical distancing: Stay at least six feet away from others in public places to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
                <li>Wash your hands regularly: Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands frequently, especially after touching high-contact surfaces.</li>
                <li>Stay home if you're sick: If you're experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, stay home and self-isolate to prevent the spread of the virus.</li>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing: Use a tissue or the inside of your elbow to cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your face: The virus can enter your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth, so it's important to avoid touching these areas.</li>
                <li>Clean and disinfect high-contact surfaces: Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Importance of Safety Measures</h2>
            <p>While vaccination is a crucial tool in the fight against COVID-19, it is important to continue practicing safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequently washing hands. It is also important to follow guidelines and regulations set by local health authorities, and to stay informed about the latest updates and news related to the pandemic.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect countries around the world, with new variants emerging and vaccination efforts ongoing. It is important for individuals to do their part in preventing the spread of the virus, and for governments and health authorities to work together to ensure the safety and wellbeing of their populations.</p>
