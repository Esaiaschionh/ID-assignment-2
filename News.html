            <p><strong>United States:</strong> The United States has surpassed 50 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

            <p><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> The UK has announced that it will offer booster shots to all adults aged 50 and over, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions, in an effort to boost immunity and protect against the Delta variant. The government has also introduced a vaccine mandate for all healthcare workers in England.</p>
            <p><strong>India:</strong> India has recorded a significant decline in COVID-19 cases, with daily infections dropping to their lowest level in four months. The country has also surpassed the milestone of administering 1 billion vaccine doses.</p>

            <p>Many countries continue to impose travel restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have closed their borders entirely to non-residents, while others require proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for entry. The restrictions have had a significant impact on the tourism industry and international travel, with many countries experiencing a sharp decline in visitors.</p>
